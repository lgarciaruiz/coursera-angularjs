Custom Services (lecture 20)
Custom service can be used to handle business logic and share code, state, data throughout app and controllers, even when controllers are not related.

Register Service Function Constructor
angular.module('appName', [])
.controller('controllerName', controllerNameFunction)
.service('serviceName', serviceNameFunction);

- the fucntion given as the parameter to the service method is treated as a function Constructor
- the name of the service is what is used to inject into other services, controllers, etc.
- guaranteed to be a singleton - can be used to share data because the one holds all the data
- Lazily instantiated

WHAT IS A SINGLETON??
Singleton Design Pattern
Restricts object to always having a single instance
- each dependent component gets a reference to the same instance
- Multiple controllers injected with a service will all have access to the same service instance
    - this enables us to share data throughout controllers and throughout the application

WHAT IS LAZILIY INSTANTIATED??
Lazily instantiated - only created if an application component declares it as a dependency
- if no components are dependent on the service it will never get created.
