ng-if, ng-show, ng-hide (lecture 22)
Directives to manipulate DOM elements

ng-if will add an element to DOM if the expression inside it evaluates to true will remove element from DOM if it's false

ng-show shows an element if the expression inside it evaluates to true otherwise it's hidden but still exists in DOM

ng-hide hides an element if the expression inside it evaluates to true otherwise it's shown
