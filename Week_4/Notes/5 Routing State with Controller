Routing State with Controller (lecture 37)
It is possible to have a controller for the html template of a route

Declare controller in state config
.state('home',{
    url: '/',
    templateUrl: 'home.html',
    controller: 'HomeCtrl as home'
});

- in the example above the controller property is set to a string that is specifing the HomeCtrl(assume HomeCtrl is defined somewhere and registered with the angular module) as home. 
- You can also do with the controllerAs property.
- you can also reference the controller function if you have access to that function at this point

- this allows for the template referenced for the state, in this case home.html, to be slimer by removing a div that gets added only to set the controller with controller as syntax

<div ng-controller="HomeCtrl as home">
<div>content</div>
</div>

becomes just
<div>content</div>

- this allows to potentially use the home.html in a different place with a completely different controller
