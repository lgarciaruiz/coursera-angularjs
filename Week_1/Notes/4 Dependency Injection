Dependency Injection (DI)
Design patter that implements inversion of control for resolving dependencies

Inverson of control (IoC) jokingly called "don't call us, we'll call you"

- client gets called with the dependency by some system
    - in our case, the system is angularjs
- client is not responsible for instiating the dependency
