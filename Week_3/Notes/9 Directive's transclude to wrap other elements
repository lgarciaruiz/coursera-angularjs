 Using Directive’s transclude to Wrap Other Elements (lecture 31)
 Pass an entire template rather than a string or object in the isolate scope of a directive. One common thing that is passed in is a dialogue box.

 transclude allows you to wrap arbitrary content with your directive including expressions and function calls in your html template.

 The expressions of are evaulated in the parents scope not in the directives scope when using transclude.

 Steps to setting up transclude
 1. Set transclude to true 
    function MyDirective() {
        var ddo = {
            scope: {...},
            transclude: true,
            templateUrl: 'url.html'
        };
        return ddo;
    }

2. Wrap some parent content
    <my-directive>
        <span>
            WARNING! WARNING! {{ ctrl.someprop }}
        </span>
    </my-directive>

    - any interpolations such as the one above are evaluated in the parent controller, NOT in our directive.

3. ng-transclude to place wrapped content
    <div>
        <div ng-transclude></div>
    </div>

    - insert evaluated wrapped content into element marked with ng-transclude

SUMMARY
- transclude allows whole tempales to be passed into a directive
- the wrapped content is evaluated in the parent's context,
NOT in the directive's context; this means that the parent's controller content will show
- in the DDO:
 transclude: true
- in Directive’s template:
    -ng-transclude attribute designates palce for evaluated wrapped content
