Watchers (lecture 14)
Watchers live inside an array on the $scope service that keep watch of properties on the scope to see if they've changed.

You can set up watchers on properties in the scope manually:

- once you create a propertie (variable) on the scope add the following code to add a watcher to it manually. 
     $scope.$watch('vaiableName', function(newValue, oldValue){
     });

Watchers will keep track of the property to see if it changed.

You should never manually add watchers to your controller code

Automatically adding watchers
When you add {{ variable }} (interpolae) to the html file, anuglar adds wathers Automatically to the variable. 

interpolated values always add a watcher.

the digest loop is fired as soon as you instantiate any variables on the scope becuase it is checking what the variables where set to.


TWO way binding - adding watcher
The other way of adding a watcher is by adding ng-model="property". anytime this changes either in the mvmv or on the view it will fire the digest cycle.
