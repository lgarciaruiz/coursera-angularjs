Filtered ng-repeat (lecture 18)

Array has a special function called filter
    - create new array where each item satisfies some condition of the comparison function passed into the filter function.


    In my own words. 

    the "filter" filter can be used in either html or js. it will create a new array elements that pass a given expression on a given array. It will create this on the fly and provide you the array. 

    This can be used to allow a user to search a list and have only the elements that match that criteria show up on the ui by giving the input element an ng-model="searchCriteria"
    and setting the searchCriteria as the filter in the filter function inside an ng-repeat directive. see lecture 18 for example

    ng-repeat="item in collection | filter: searchCriteria"

    the filer filter is similar in what it does to the filter array method
