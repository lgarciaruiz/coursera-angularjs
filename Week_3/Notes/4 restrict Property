restrict Property of the Directive Definition Object (DDO) - (lecture 27)

the restrict property tells the angularjs compiler what dom elements it should replace with the template of the DDO

- default is AE - Attribute or Element

function MyDirective(){
    var ddo = {
        restrict : 'A' //restricting to Attributes only
    }

    return ddo;
}

- It is a best practice to restrict to attribute if directive is extending behavior, eg ng-repeat; it doesnt have any content of its own but it's giving some behavior

- Best practice: restrict to element if is defining a component with an associate template, like our <list-item></list-item> the template has content

- Best practice: to not restrict to classes or comments
    - this was used for old browser compatability and not used anymore

When restricting a directive make sure that your template for the directive makes sense within the context of your app

Once you restrict to certain DOM elements the angularjs compiler will ignore any DOM elements that should not be used becasue of the restict params
