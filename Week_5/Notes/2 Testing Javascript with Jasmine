Testing Javascript with Jasmine

Unit Testing
Independent checking for proper operation of the smallest testable part of an application
    - Independent: isolated from the rest of the system
    - Smallest testable - means you have to approach all of the code development from this perspective
    - Should be repeatable - meaning new code additions should still pass

mocking
technique where dependency and its behavior is imitated (or faked)
- can be done by the developer or a mocking library


Testing Framework
Jasmine


Steps for using Jasmine
- download and unzip jasmine standalone into a directory
    - https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases
- erase everything in src and spec directories
- place you aplication code into the src directory
- place test code or a spec into the spec directory
- update SpecRunner.html
    - replace references to erased src and spec files with yours
- start browser-sync (or whatever you use for local server) and go to http://../SpecRunner.html to have your specs run

Writing a Spec (test)
describe('My Functon', function(){
    var initValue;

    beforeEach(function(){
        initValue = 'someValue';
    });

    it should('Should not return true', function(){
        var result = someFunc(initValue);
        expect(result).not.toBe(true);
    });
});

- describe is a container for all our tests
- optionally add beforeEach: whatever you add to this function will be invoked to each test before it is run
- it - is the actual test
