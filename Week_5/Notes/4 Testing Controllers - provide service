Testing AngularJS Controllers (lecture 44)
In the file named Testing controllers we went over creating a service manually without help from angularjs.

There is another way to create mock service, factories, directives, etc. usin the provide service.


$provide, steps

1. Setup mock service with $provide
    beforeEach(function(){
        //inject the provide service using the module method; you cannot inject non provide services
        module(function($provide){
            //create service using the $provide service method
            $provide.service('MockService', function(){
                var service = this;
                service.aMethod = function(){
                    return 'fake-value';
                };
            });       
        });
        module('myApp');
    });
    
    - in the code above the service is injected to the module method and defined inline as a callback
    - the first argument is the defined string name to inject into other calls
    - we don't need to save the service to a variable in the describe method becuase it is injected into the module

2. inject the service into the next beforeEach method

var $controller;
var myCrtrl;

beforeEach(inject(function(_$controller_,MockService){
    $controller = _$controller_;

    myCrtrl = $controller('MyCtrl', { MyService: MockService });
}));

3. Create tests

    it('should update init value on item add', function(){
        myCtrl.addItem();
        expect(myCtrl.value).toBe('fake-value');
    });
 }); //end of describe method

 Summary
 - angular provides ngMock module to help with unit Testing
 - to test a controller you need:
    - load module controller lives in using angular.mock.module('name'); shorthand is module('name');
    - use $controller to instantiate controller you want to test
    - use controller instance to invoke methods, access props, etc.
- Do most of the setup in beforeEach
    - At least module('name') loading, but maybe more
- $provide service can be inject only into module('name')
- for other services, use angular.mock.inject method
