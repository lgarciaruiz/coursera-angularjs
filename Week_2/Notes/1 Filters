Filters (Lecture 12 code)
construct to change output of expression.
- need to inject filter service

var ouptut = $filter('uppercase')(value);

filter service is filter function creating service, meaning in the example above the $filter('uppercase') is creating the function and then calling it on (value). Then returns the outcome.

Sometimes the filter functions have custom arguments that change the filtering output. 

var ouptut = $filter('currency')(value, customArg1, customArg2);

- the custom arguments are specific to each filter type.

You can also use these filtering feactures in the html part of your doc by placing a pipe and the type of filter afterwards in your {{}}
    {{ "Hello" | uppercase }} it can also be a variable that exists in the $scope

These also take custom arguments
    {{ "hell" | currency : arg1 : arg2 }}

Refer to the angularJs documentation for list of filters and custom arguments each one accepts
